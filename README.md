# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm.

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with two players, X and O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its next move. The algorithm works by recursively evaluating all possible moves and their outcomes, and choosing the best move based on the minimum possible maximum loss.



## How to Run

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` 

## How to Play

To make a move, simply click on the space where you'd like to place your symbol. 
The game will print the current state of the board after each move, and will let you know when the game is over.
